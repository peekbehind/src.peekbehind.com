        of the visitors of your web site?

    <h2 id="about">About</h2>

    <p>
      PeekBehind shows the mouse cursors of your latest users
      as ghosts layered on top of each page of your web site.
    </p>

    <p>
      This visualization,
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_%28video_gaming%29"
      >inspired from video games</a>,
      is a modern and efficient
      way to gain insights in the patterns of use of interactive applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/"
      >As stated by usability expert Jakob Nielsen</a>,
      as little as 5 users are sufficient to identify the strength
      and shortcomings of a user interface.
    </p>

    <p>
      With PeekBehind, as soon as you navigate to a page of your own web site,
      you see a replay of the activity recorded for the 5 most recent visitors
      of the page, shown simultaneously.
    </p>

    <p>
      PeekBehind respects the privacy of your visitors and records nothing
      when the <a href="http://donottrack.us/">"Do Not Track" preference</a>
      of the browser is checked. You can take advantage of this exception
      to avoid recording the activity of yourself and your own employees.
