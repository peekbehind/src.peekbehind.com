    Generate HTML5 doctype

    Set HTML5 doctype with XSLT

    Based on answer by Dirk Vollmar
    http://stackoverflow.com/a/3387532

    The main differences are:
    1) this template is designed to be imported from another transformation,
       and does not include the output declaration (no indent)
    2) a newline character is inserted after the doctype declaration
       to make sure that it stands on its own for higher compatibility
       with browsers

    In: XHTML page
    Out: XHTML page with HTML5 doctype
